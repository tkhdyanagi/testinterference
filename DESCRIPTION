Description: Examining whether there are treatment spillovers and how to specify the structure of the interference is an important task in statistical applications.
    This package provides tools to perform randomization tests to examine how to specify the interference structure.
    Specifically, the package enables to perform randomization tests on whether or not the following null hypotheses are plausible.
    1. Fisher's sharp null hypothesis (one's outcome does not depend on one's own treatment).
    2. The stable unit treatment value assumption (one's outcome is determined by one's own treatment).
    3. Exposure 1 (one's outcome is determined by whether there is at least one treated unit in one's neighborhood including oneself).
    4. Exposure 2 (one's outcome is determined by one's own treatment and whether there is at least one treated peer).
    The testing procedures are developed by Hoshino and Yanagi (2023)<doi:10.48550/arXiv.2301.05580>.
